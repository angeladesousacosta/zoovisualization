## Determining Zoo Animals Taxon Class Based on their Median Life Expectancy

A project for DASC 4850: Introduction to Data Science and Analytics in Python I. In this project, the core question was "How can we determine zoo animals taxon class based on their median life expectancy?" I did an explority data analysis using visualizations and correlations. I also built and tested a model to address my question of interest.
